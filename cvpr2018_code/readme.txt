code plan for cvpr 2018

1. synthetic data

50 docs , 10 topics , 200 words per doc.
use two layer HDDCRP with no distance information . just to see whether the inference algorithm is right or not.

Purpose: get the topic correctly, hope to have 11 topics which cotain the true 10 topics

a.show me 10 topics.
b.show me 50 docs , each 200 words , which must be disordered.
c.show me the topic after 1000 iterations.
d.record the likelihood in each iteration.
e.when creating the docs , record the groundtruth topic ,and then calculate the correctness.(Set this aside)
